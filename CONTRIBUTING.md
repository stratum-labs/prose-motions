# Contributing to Prose Motions

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

This document describes the development workflow, code style, and tooling used in this monorepo so that you can get productive quickly and send high-quality pull requests.

## 1. Getting started

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) â‰¥ 1.1.8 (used for package management & the dev server).
2. Clone the repo and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stratum-labs/prose-motions.git
   cd prose-motions
   bun install
   ```
3. Build once or start the watcher:

   ```bash
   bun run build   # one-off build (ESM + CJS + declaration files)
   bun run dev     # fast rebuilds with --watch
   ```

The build emits artifacts into `packages/core/dist` so that they can be required/imported directly from Node or bundlers.

## 2. Project layout

```
prose-motions
â”œâ”€ packages/
â”‚  â””â”€ core/          # source of @prose-motions/core â€“ editor extension
â”‚     â”œâ”€ src/
â”‚     â”œâ”€ dist/       # generated artefacts (ignored by git)
â”‚     â””â”€ tests/
â”œâ”€ index.ts          # Bun demo entry-point
â”œâ”€ eslint.config.json
â””â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Key facts:
 - Each workspace is completely independent and publishes its own artefacts.
 - SWC (`.swcrc`) controls TSâ†’JS compilation; we never ship `ts-node` at runtime.
 - Declarations are generated once via `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json`.

---

## 3. Development workflow

### Hot-reloading during feature work

```
bun run --hot packages/core dev
```

This will re-execute SWC on every change and write to `packages/core/dist`.  You can link this folder into another local project with `npm/yarn/bun link` if you want to test the extension in a real editor.

### Adding new motions or commands

1. Open `packages/core/src/VimMode.ts` and locate the keyboard-shortcut map.
2. Implement the new command as a pure function that receives `CommandProps` â€“ do **not** touch the DOM.
3. Write unit tests (see next section) that cover cursor movement at document edges and across multi-line content.

### Docs & playground

If you update the public API, please update the examples in the README as well.

---

## 4. Tests

We use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for ultra-fast in-memory tests:

```bash
bun run test        # interactive UI
bun run test --run  # CI-friendly non-interactive mode
```

Write table-driven tests where possible. Each test file should be colocated next to the source (`*.test.ts`).

---

## 5. Linting & formatting

 - ESLint config inherits from `@antfu/eslint-config`. Run `bun run lint` to see issues.
 - Prettier 3 is used for Markdown & JSON files; run `npx prettier --check .` before pushing.
 - CI will fail if lint errors are introduced.

---

## 6. Commit conventions & PR checklist

We loosely follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) so that future automated changelog tooling can be added easily. Short summary:

```
<type>(scope): summary

feat(core): add `w` motion
fix: handle cursor at doc start in `b` motion
```

Before opening a PR:

1. `bun run build` succeeds with no type errors.
2. `bun run test --run` passes.
3. `bun run lint` passes.
4. Update docs / README if public behaviour changed.

---

## 7. Release process (maintainers only)

Releases are managed manually for now:

1. Increment version in `packages/core/package.json` following semver.
2. Run `bun run build` and commit the updated `dist/` artefacts **(do not** edit them by hand).
3. Tag the commit (`git tag vX.Y.Z && git push --tags`).
4. Publish from the workspace root:

   ```bash
   npm publish ./packages/core --access public
   ```

CI/CD automation will come later â€“ see Roadmap.

---

## 8. Code of conduct

Be excellent to each other. We follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) â€“ harassment, discrimination, or toxic behaviour will not be tolerated.

Happy hacking! âœ¨
